## 💅 Why SCSS Structure??

| Benefit | How it Helps |
|---------|-------------|
| **Easy to Find** | Looking for button styles? Check `_buttons.scss` |
| **Easy to Update** | Change a color in `_variables.scss`, affects entire app |
| **No Repetition** | Use mixins instead of writing same CSS multiple times |
| **Scalable** | Easy to add new components - just create new file |
| **Professional** | Industry-standard approach used by top companies |

# Note [Don't Forget!!] : SASS and SCSS are both syntaxes of the SASS (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) preprocessor, each offering enhanced features that extend the capabilities of traditional CSS. While both share the same functionality, their syntaxes differ, catering to different preferences among developers. (I have used SCSS & SASS interchangably here.)
